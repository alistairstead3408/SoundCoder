You need to have the following installed:
XCode
Swig (installed by hand, not using ports)
android-ndk-r4 in the ../../ directory
opencv in the ../../ directory, compiled

If there are any errors, it's likely due to the MK files
not being setup properly.

Application.mk and Android.mk

especially the required platform number in Application.mk
